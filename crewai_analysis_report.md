Okay, let’s dive into collecting comprehensive data for the smart fan market on YouTube, focusing specifically on videos related to Atomberg and competitors. This will involve a multi-faceted approach combining YouTube search, data extraction, and analysis. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the data I’ll gather and how I’ll structure it, aiming for a complete and insightful picture.

**1. Video Metadata Collection:**

*   **Search Query:** I’ll use YouTube’s advanced search to identify videos matching the following keywords: “smart fan,” “fan accessories,” “Atomberg,” “fan controller,” “fan amplifier,” “fan boost,” “fan amplifier kit,” “fan customization,” and variations thereof. I’ll refine the search further by including specific model names (e.g., “Atomberg Fan Controller X”). I’ll also incorporate terms like “fan control,” “fan features,” “fan improvements,” “fan technology,” and “fan optimization.”
*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Title:** Extract the video title, including any relevant keywords.
    *   **Description:** Analyze the description for key phrases, product features, and overall content. I'll look for mentions of specific features (e.g., “adjustable gain,” “Bluetooth connectivity,” “customizable LED strips,” “fan speed control,” “fan power boost,” “fan resonance,” “fan optimization”). I’ll also analyze the presence of calls to action like “Learn More” or “Shop Now”.
    *   **Views:** Count the total views for each video.
    *   **Likes:** Count the total likes.
    *   **Comments:** Analyze the number and sentiment of comments. I'll categorize comments as:
        *   **Positive:** Expressing satisfaction, appreciation, or excitement.
        *   **Negative:** Expressing dissatisfaction, complaints, or concerns.
        *   **Neutral:**  Informational, factual, or simply expressing an opinion.
        *   **Spam:**  Unsolicited or irrelevant comments.
    *   **Tags:** Extract relevant tags (e.g., “fan controller,” “Atomberg,” “fan accessories,” “music,” “gaming,” “fan technology,” “fan amplifier,” “fan optimization,” “fan customization”). I'll also look for tags related to specific features.
    *   **Channel:** Identify the channel posting the video (if available).
    *   **Upload Date/Time:** Analyze trends in upload timing.
*   **Tools:** YouTube Data API (for retrieving video metadata –  I’ll focus on the title, description, and tags).

**2. Comment Data – Sentiment Analysis & Brand Mention Tracking:**

*   **Sentiment Analysis:** I’ll use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library (like TextBlob or NLTK in Python) to perform sentiment analysis on each comment. This will categorize comments as:
    *   **Positive:** Expressing satisfaction, appreciation, or excitement.
    *   **Negative:** Expressing dissatisfaction, complaints, or concerns.
    *   **Neutral:**  Informational, factual, or simply expressing an opinion.
    *   **Spam:**  Unsolicited or irrelevant comments.
*   **Brand Mention Tracking:** This is the core of the analysis.
    *   **Atomberg:** I'll use a regular expression to identify and count mentions of "Atomberg" and related terms (e.g., "Atomberg Fan Controller X,” “Atomberg X Series”). I'll also look for mentions of specific Atomberg models (e.g., "Atomberg Fan Controller 3.0").  I’ll also consider mentions of competitors whose products are viewed as alternatives (e.g., Audio-Technica, Sennheiser, Yamaha).
*   **Comment Structure:** I'll extract the text of the comment.
*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Comment Text:** The actual text of the comment.
    *   **Timestamp:** When the comment was made.
    *   **User ID:** (If available) – potentially link to user activity.
    *   **Sentiment Score:** A numerical score representing the overall sentiment of the comment.
    *   **Brand Mention Count:** The number of times the brand "Atomberg" or competitor brands are mentioned.
    *   **Hashtags:** Extract relevant hashtags used in the comment.
*   **Tools:** Python (for sentiment analysis and regex).

**3. Engagement Metrics Analysis:**

*   **Total Likes/Dislikes:** Calculate the total likes and dislikes for each video.
*   **Average Like/Dislike Ratio:** Calculate the ratio of likes to dislikes.
*   **Comment Activity:** Analyze the frequency and sentiment of comments. I'll look for patterns in comments – are there specific types of comments that correlate with positive or negative engagement?
*   **Video Views Over Time:** Track views over time to identify trends in engagement.
*   **Comments per View:** Calculate the average number of comments per view.
*   **Channel Engagement:** Analyze the engagement rates of different channels (based on likes, comments, and shares).
*   **Search Term Analysis:** Examine the search terms used to find the video. Are users searching for specific features?

**4. Data Visualization & Reporting:**

*   **Dashboard:** Create a dashboard to visualize the collected data. This will include:
    *   **Key Metrics:** Likes, views, sentiment, brand mention count, comment activity, video views over time, and comments per view.

    *   **Comment Activity Analysis:**  A heatmap showing the distribution of comments across different comment types (positive, negative, neutral).

    *   A detailed analysis of the market landscape.
    *   Identification of popular features and trends.
    *   Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of Atomberg and competitors.
